# BobHamelers-Unit6-HistoryQuiz

This app is a history quiz. At first, a user has to sign up with an account. This is a connection with Firebase.

After the user has done this, the user will automatically login but the user can login by his- or herself. 

If the e-mail adress has no @ sign, or if the password is less then 6 characters or a user will not type in anything, the user will get an alert. (Example picture below here, but not every failure alert has a picture below.)

After this the user will start at an introductionscreen where a user can logout and start the quiz.

When a user starts the quiz, the user will get random questions from an API (triviaDB). The questions are True-False questions.
If the API doesn't load, the user will see a loading page (no picture of it below because API simulator is too fast).

When a user has finished the quiz, the user will see his or her score in results. A user can go back to the introductionview or the user can see the leaderbord.

In the leaderbord the user can see the best score of every user sorted from high to low.
